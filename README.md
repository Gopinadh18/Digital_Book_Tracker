Book Finder App

This is a Book Finder App built using React.js. It allows users to search for books by title and view details such as the author, first published year, language, and edition count.

The app fetches data from the Open Library API.

It includes loading and error handling.

The UI is responsive and works well on different screen sizes.

Users can see the book cover images, and if no cover is available, a placeholder image is displayed.
